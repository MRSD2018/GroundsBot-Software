"""Executable for the Earth Engine command line interface.

This executable starts a Python Cmd instance to receive and process command
line input entered by the user. If the executable is invoked with some
command line arguments, the Cmd is launched in the one-off mode, where
the provided arguments are processed as a single command after which the
program is terminated. Otherwise, this executable will launch the Cmd in the
interactive (looping) mode, where the user will be able to run multiple
commands as in a typical terminal program.
